# WooCommerce Bookings Order Item Meta Addon

This addon is a WooCommerce Bookings helper which will make it so future booking orders have meta data saved within the order as they did with version 1.9.12 and below. This will enable the meta data for all new orders, it does not modify existing orders. 

This addon is to be used at the admin's discretion in a testing environment before adding it to a live environment.

# Usage

Install and activate the plugin. That's all.
